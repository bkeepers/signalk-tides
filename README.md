# signalk-tides-API

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joabakk/signalk-tides-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joabakk/signalk-tides-api)

This is a copy of sbender9's derived-data, because well, APIs are not derived from other values.

Currently serving worldtide.info API and NOAA free data, it can potentially serve other APIs and web sources for tidal data. Please feel free to contribute
